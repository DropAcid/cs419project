I'm posting my entire CS419 runtime and testing environment that I use on FLIP.  Much is WIP, but many parts are working.  As of this morning (2/7) I have a successful test case for receiving a new appointment email and having it work all the way through the system, i.e. it routes through .procmailrc, filters the email to extract data, updates the database, and sends a working Outlook calendar item with a reproduceable unique ID.

On FLIP I have this CS419 in my user directory (path = ~/CS419) which is the same folder where .procmailrc resides.
