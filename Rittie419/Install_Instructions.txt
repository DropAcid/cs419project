---Non-Installation Portion, just for replication---
* Added the CS419 folder and contents and launcher.py to my main directory
* command: tar -jcvf group8_project.tar.bz2 CS419 launcher.py


======Installation=============
1. The tar.bz2 file needs to be placed in the user's main directory
2. The user will enter command "tar -jxvf group8_project.tar.bz2"
	* This will place the required CS419 directory and the launcher.py file into the user's main directory
3. From main directory, user will run command "python launcher.py"
4. Program will open and the user should choose a valid menu option:
	* Option 1 - This will check for a .procmailrc file, and create one if needed. This will also check for a .forward file, and instruct the user how to handle it.
		+ The .procmailrc must contain two rules for the user's advising system to function. It is recommended that the rules be first two rules in the .procmailrc file. The order of the rules in the file matters and will impact functionality. This option does NOT check the .procmailrc file for specific rules, it only checks for existence of the file. The rules are:
			:0 fW:
			* ^From[: ].*do.not.reply@engr.orst.edu
			* ^Subject:.*Advising Signup
			| python ~/CS419/procfilter.py


			:0
			* ^From[: ].*do.not.reply@engr.orst.edu
			* ^Subject:.*Advising Signup
			/dev/null

		+ A .forward file in the user's main directory will interfere with the system and prevent proper functionality. If a .forward file exists the user should remove it from the directory.
			- Email forwarding can be removed and added at any time via TEACH.
			- A user can later reset all the the .(dot)files at any time via TEACH by using the "Reset UNIX Config Files".
	* Option 2 - Launch the command line interface.
		+ A check for a .forward file is performed when this option is selected. Information about how the user should handle the .forward file can be found in part 4.
	* Option 3 - Exit the launcher.
