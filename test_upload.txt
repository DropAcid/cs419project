Testing upload using git from command line --Rittie

Documenting steps I took to upload file successfully using git from Linux command line ($=prompt).
1. go to directory where git project directory will be located
2. clone the git directory
  $git clone https://github.com/jeffrix/cs419project.git
3. go to project directory
  $cd cs419project
4. add the remote repository (call it 'upstream')
  $git remote add upstream git://github.com/jeffrix/cs419project.git
5. create file, or move file into, local git directory (i.e. cs419project)
6. add file to git index
  $git add test_upload.txt
7. commit file locally
  $git commmit -m "Rittie testing file upload"
8. upload to team site - publish local commit to origin/master
  $git push

git prompted me for username and password when publishing to team site (step 8)
